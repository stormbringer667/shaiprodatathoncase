# DevSecOps AI Assistant — Integration Bundle

This bundle packages each integration "point" into its own folder with scripts/configs.
It’s derived from your PDF (“DevSecOps AI Assistant — Команды интеграции компонентов”). 
Where the PDF had truncated lines, sensible defaults are added and marked as **TODO**.

## Structure

- `01-kafka/` — create/list topics.
- `02-elasticsearch/` — index templates + helper script.
- `03-influxdb/` — DB/RP/CQ init (InfluxQL) and notes for InfluxDB v2.
- `04-clickhouse/` — DDL for analytics tables and MV.
- `05-neo4j/` — indexes, constraints, demo topology.
- `06-python/` — producers/consumer/Flink processor/AI agent/monitoring.
- `07-systemd/` — systemd unit files for producers, consumer, agent.
- `08-fluent-bit/` — fluent-bit.conf + parsers.conf.
- `09-tests/` — end‑to‑end integration test script.
- `10-ansible/` — one‑shot playbook + templates.
- `11-init/` — initialize_databases.sh (cross‑service bootstrap).
- `12-grafana-prometheus/` — prometheus.yml, alert rules, Grafana dashboard.

> Notes:
> * Replace placeholders like `your-openai-api-key`, `your_password`, tokens, and paths to GeoIP databases.
> * Topic partitions/replication‑factor filled with safe defaults; tune per cluster size.
> * Service names assume Debian/Ubuntu package defaults; adjust for your distro.
